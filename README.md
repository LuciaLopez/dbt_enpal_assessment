Note:
Please note that I got this warning:
 warning: in the working copy of 'raw_data/load_data.sh', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it 
warning: in the working copy of 'target/index.html', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it

I had to touch that file because it was throwing some problems to be executed in my local machine.

Thank you!
